        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

        <h3><strong>What is a Yurt?</strong></h3>
            <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
                Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</p>
        <h3><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
            <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
                The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.
                Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
        <h3><strong>What should I bring?</strong></h3>
            <p>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax!
                Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
                for changing weather with layers of clothing.</p>
